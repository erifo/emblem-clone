# Fire Emblem Clone
*Disclaimer: Never actually played Fire Emblem, but it's the closest way I can think of summing this project up.*

### Todo
* Unit interaction.
* Board switching.
* Procedurally generated boards.

### Specifications
* Using Pygame 2.0.0
* The board should consist of and be measured in cells.
* A cell's render-size should be dynamic to allow for zoom.
* Toggle-able menus should be able to overlay the board.
* Units, each taking up one cell, should be able to move in turns on the board.
* Units should belong to different factions and initate combat if moving into different-factioned units.
* Combat should be displayed as a scrolling log of text detailing what happens.
